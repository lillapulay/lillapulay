# 👋 Hi there! 

🌿 My name is Lilla. I'm a front-end developer with a love for the creation process and a strong interest in UX.  
💻 I have over 3 years of experience in the field, primarily with React, along with some (~1 year) exposure to Angular.  
🧹 I care about writing clean, maintainable code and truly understanding what I’m doing, while also imagining myself in the user’s shoes.  
🚀 I aim to grow into a senior developer role where I can support more junior colleagues and help foster a healthy, collaborative team culture.  
🤝 I thrive in cross-functional teams and value flexibility, clarity, and purpose — where time is used well and everyone is encouraged to do their best work, while still having fun.




## 💻 What I’m up to

🗺️ Working at [Esri Nederland](https://www.esri.nl/nl-nl/home) as an Engineer, building very *spatial* applications using mostly [React](https://reactjs.org), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/), and the [Calcite Design System](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/)  
🐍 Learning Python, so far with zero *bytes* - oh, wait...  
🏗️ Rebuilding my portfolio with Next.js. Total overkill for a small site — so naturally, I’m doing my best to make it spiral out of control  
🤔 Cooking up a side project idea with Angular — I really enjoyed working with this framework and want to dive deeper into its bells and whistles




## 🧠 Fun(?) facts

✈️ Originally from Hungary, I’ve been living in the Netherlands since 2019  
🎓 Former law & international studies grad turned frontend developer — because who likes life on easy mode, *amirite?*  
🧳 After moving abroad, I survived a temp job that went against everything in my nature, pushed through two coding bootcamps, and landed my first dev job in early 2022  
🗣️ I enjoy learning languages — besides "compulsory" Dutch, Norwegian is my current pet project   
😵‍💫 As a junior, I once wrote ~80 lines of code to position a close button on a modal, which the lead dev later replaced with two lines of CSS. I’m still not okay.




## 🐾 Outside the IDE...

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:

🐦🐕 Chasing my cheeky lovebirds and dog out of the kitchen  
🌱 Fully embracing my ever-growing plantaholism — though I haven’t *botany* lately  
🦆 Wandering around in nature, searching for inner peace and more ducks  
🎧📚🎮🖌️ Mixing in a healthy dose of music, reading, gaming, and all sorts of creative, crafty stuffies - ever knocked over a diamond painting tray at 9 PM? So. Much. Fun.

## 🧐 FAQ (Or not)

**☕ Coffee or Tea?**  
Yes.

**🐞 Is it a bug or a feature?**  
Ask me again in half an hour. 

**📅 Where are your pretty green GitHub activity cubes?**  
Hiding on Bitbucket and Azure DevOps. They said GitHub needed a break from my chaos. 🥴

**💻 Where are your side projects?**  
Probably still stuck in traffic. Also, my plants needed watering. 🤷‍♀️

**🚀 Dream project?**  
I once had a perfectly documented app with zero bugs, no failing tests and a UI that actually delighted users; a project planned within a realistic timeframe and resourced just right... Alas, then I awoke. ⏰

**❔ Tabs vs. spaces?**  
Tabs. Gives a good excuse as to why my Caps Lock is accidentally on and why all my case sensitive stuff is going belly up. 👌
